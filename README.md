# Lab_Website_3
i am having a lot of trouble uploading the node_modules files. I'm running into issues with the WebGUI and through the terminal, however I didn't make any changes to those files

In the terminal I get these error messages but I'm not sure why:
To https://github.com/namitapasupuleti/Lab_Website_3.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/namitapasupuleti/Lab_Website_3.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
